For this assignment, I added text areas and buttons for each of the hours.
Then, I used moment.js to use the time that the function would use to color-code the time blocks
Then, I made a function that checked the current time and made sure that each timeblock was the right color depedending on if the timeblock was in the past, present, or future.
Then, I created variables to store the text that the user input in local storage and print them back onto the textbox after the page was refreshed.
